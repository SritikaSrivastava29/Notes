**PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS**

## **Introduction**
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells and is essential for life on Earth as it provides the primary energy source for all living organisms.

### **What Do We Know?**
Photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The process occurs in two stages:
1. **Light-dependent reactions** (Light Reactions) – occur in the thylakoid membranes.
2. **Light-independent reactions** (Dark Reactions) – occur in the stroma.

## **Early Experiments**
### **Priestley's Experiment**
Joseph Priestley (1770) demonstrated that plants release oxygen. He conducted an experiment where a candle burned out in a closed jar, but when a mint plant was placed in the jar, the candle could be relit, indicating that the plant produced oxygen.

### **Detailed Explanation**
Priestley's experiment proved that plants purify the air by releasing oxygen. This discovery laid the foundation for understanding photosynthesis.

### **Reactions**
CO₂ + H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂

## **Where Does Photosynthesis Take Place?**
Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, which are double-membrane organelles present in plant cells.

### **Chloroplast Structure**
- **Outer Membrane**: Permeable to small molecules.
- **Inner Membrane**: Regulates passage of materials.
- **Stromal Lamellae**: Connect grana stacks.
- **Grana**: Stacks of thylakoids where light reactions occur.
- **Stroma**: Fluid-filled space where dark reactions take place.
- **Ribosomes**: Help in protein synthesis.
- **Starch Granule**: Stores carbohydrates.
- **Lipid Droplet**: Stores lipids.

## **Types of Pigments Involved in Photosynthesis**
- **Chlorophyll a** – Primary pigment, absorbs red & blue light.
- **Chlorophyll b** – Accessory pigment, absorbs green light.
- **Carotenoids** – Absorb blue and green light, protect chlorophyll.
- **Xanthophylls** – Absorb violet and blue light.
- **VIBGYOR** – Represents the light spectrum.

### **Electron Transport System (ETS)**
- A series of cytochromes transport electrons.
- **Z-Scheme**: Represents the pathway of electron flow.
- **Splitting of Water**: Provides electrons, releases O₂.

**Reaction:**
2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂

## **Cyclic and Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation**
### **Cyclic Photophosphorylation**
- Produces **ATP** but no **NADPH**.
- Uses **Photosystem I** only.

### **Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation**
- Produces **ATP and NADPH**.
- Uses **both PSI and PSII**.

## **Chemiosmotic Hypothesis**
### **ATP Synthesis Through Chemiosmosis**
- Movement of protons creates a proton gradient.
- ATP is synthesized as protons pass through ATP synthase.

### **Key Components:**
- **Cytochrome b6f**
- **Plastocyanin**
- **Thylakoid Membrane**
- **Stroma (H⁺ Low) and Lumen (H⁺ High)**

## **Where Are ATP and NADPH Used?**
Used in the **Calvin Cycle** (Dark Reaction) for carbohydrate synthesis.

### **Biosynthetic Phase (Dark Reaction)**
- **C3 Pathway**: Calvin Cycle
- **C4 Pathway**: Hatch & Slack Pathway

## **The Calvin Cycle**
Occurs in all photosynthetic plants.

### **Phases:**
1. **Carboxylation** – CO₂ fixation by RuBisCO.
2. **Reduction** – Formation of G3P (triose phosphate).
3. **Regeneration** – Regeneration of RuBP.

**Reaction:**
3CO₂ + 9ATP + 6NADPH → G3P + 9ADP + 6NADP⁺

## **The C4 Pathway**
### **Key Features:**
- **Kranz Anatomy** – Bundle sheath cells surround vascular bundles.
- **PEP Carboxylase** – Fixes CO₂ into oxaloacetate (OAA).
- **Decarboxylation** – Releases CO₂ for Calvin Cycle.

### **Hatch & Slack Pathway Representation**
- **Plasmo-desmata** – Connects mesophyll & bundle sheath cells.
- **Atmospheric CO₂ Fixation** – Ensures efficient photosynthesis.

## **Photorespiration**
- Wastage process where **O₂ competes with CO₂** for RuBisCO.
- Produces **no ATP or NADPH**.

### **C3 vs C4 Plants (Comparison Table)**
| Feature        | C3 Plants | C4 Plants |

| Primary Enzyme | RuBisCO  | PEP Carboxylase |
| Efficiency    | Lower    | Higher   |
| Photorespiration | High | Low |

## **Factors Affecting Photosynthesis**
1. **Law of Limiting Factors** – The rate is determined by the scarcest resource.
2. **Light Intensity** – Affects rate of photosynthesis.
3. **CO₂ Concentration** – More CO₂ increases the rate.
4. **Temperature** – Affects enzyme activity.
5. **Water** – Essential for photolysis.
