# Chapter 7 Notes

### Organ and Organ System in Frogs  

- **Frogs**:  
  Frogs are amphibians, meaning they can live both on land and in water. They have well-developed organ systems that support their dual lifestyle. Key features include a three-chambered heart, lungs for breathing air, and skin that assists in respiration.

- **Poikilotherms**:  
  Frogs are cold-blooded animals, also known as poikilotherms. This means their body temperature fluctuates with the surrounding environmental temperature. They lack the ability to regulate their internal temperature independently, relying instead on behavioral adaptations like basking in the sun or seeking shade.

- **Aestivation**:  
  During hot and dry periods, frogs undergo aestivation, a state of dormancy to survive unfavorable conditions. During this time, frogs reduce their metabolic rate, burrow into the soil, or hide in moist areas to conserve water and energy. Aestivation prevents dehydration and helps frogs survive extreme heat.

- **Hibernation**:  
  Frogs enter hibernation during cold conditions, such as winter, to survive freezing temperatures. They slow down their metabolic processes and take shelter in places like burrows, under logs, or at the bottom of water bodies where the temperature is relatively stable. Some species can even survive freezing conditions by producing antifreeze-like substances in their bodies.

### Morphology of Frogs  

- **Trunk**:  
  The trunk is the main part of the body, compact and streamlined, aiding in smooth movement both on land and in water. It lacks a tail in adult frogs and contains internal organs.  

- **Head**:  
  The head is broad and flat, housing the mouth, nostrils, and sensory organs like eyes and tympanum (eardrum). It plays a vital role in feeding, respiration, and sensory functions.  

- **Eye**:  
  Frogs have large, bulging eyes with a nictitating membrane that protects them and allows vision underwater. Their eyes are crucial for spotting prey and detecting predators.  

- **Forelimb**:  
  The forelimbs are short and muscular, helping in supporting the body, balance, and cushioning during landing after jumping. They also assist in burrowing and minor movements.  

- **Hind Limb**:  
  The hind limbs are long, strong, and webbed, adapted for powerful leaps and efficient swimming. Their structure helps in propulsion and escape from predators.

### Anatomy of Frogs  

- **Heart**:  
  A three-chambered organ with two atria and one ventricle, responsible for circulating oxygenated and deoxygenated blood throughout the body.  

- **Oesophagus**:  
  A short, muscular tube connecting the mouth to the stomach, enabling the passage of food.

  Yellow, finger-like structures near the kidneys that store energy, especially for hibernation and reproduction.  

- **Kidney**:  
  Paired, elongated organs that filter blood, excrete nitrogenous wastes, and regulate water balance.  

- **Stomach**:  
  A muscular organ that mechanically and chemically digests food using enzymes and gastric juices.  

- **Intestine**:  
  A coiled tube where nutrient absorption occurs, divided into the small intestine (digestion and absorption) and the large intestine (water absorption).  

- **Rectum**:  
  The terminal part of the large intestine where waste is temporarily stored before excretion.  

- **Urinary Bladder**:  
  A thin, sac-like structure that stores urine before it is expelled.  

- **Cloaca**:  
  A common chamber that receives waste from the rectum, urine from the bladder, and gametes from reproductive organs for excretion.  

- **Cloacal Aperture**:  
  An external opening at the end of the cloaca, used for the elimination of waste and release of gametes

  ### Male Reproductive System of Frogs
