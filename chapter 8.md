### **CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE**  

#### **What is a Cell?**  
Cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are composed of cells, which vary in shape, size, and function. Some organisms, like bacteria, consist of a single cell (unicellular), whereas others, like humans, are made up of billions of cells (multicellular).

### **Cell Theory**  
The cell theory, proposed by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann and later expanded by Rudolf Virchow, states that:  
1. All living organisms are composed of cells.  
2. The cell is the basic unit of life.  
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells.

### **An Overview of Cell Cycle**  
The cell cycle is a series of events that cells go through as they grow and divide. It consists of two main phases:  
1. **Interphase** â€“ The period of cell growth and DNA replication.  
2. **M Phase (Mitotic Phase)** â€“ The phase of actual cell division, which includes mitosis and cytokinesis.

## **Prokaryotic Cell**  
Prokaryotic cells are simpler and smaller in structure compared to eukaryotic cells. They lack a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Examples include bacteria and cyanobacteria.  

### **PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organism)**  
PPLO, also known as *Mycoplasma*, is the smallest known living organism. It lacks a cell wall, making it resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis.

## **Cell Envelope and its Modifications**  
The cell envelope is a protective covering present in prokaryotic cells. It consists of three layers: **Glycocalyx, Cell Wall, and Plasma Membrane.**  

1. **Glycocalyx** â€“ The outermost layer, which can be a slime layer or a capsule.  
2. **Cell Wall** â€“ Provides structural support and shape.  
3. **Plasma Membrane** â€“ A selectively permeable membrane that regulates the movement of substances.  

### **Forms of Vesicles**  
Vesicles are small, membrane-bound structures involved in storage, transport, and cellular communication. In prokaryotes, they help in nutrient storage and waste disposal.  

### **Tubules and Lamellae**  
- **Tubules** are cylindrical structures involved in transport and cellular organization.  
- **Lamellae** are thin, plate-like structures that play a role in photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.  

### **Filament, Hook, and Basal Body**  
These are components of bacterial flagella, which help in motility.  
1. **Filament** â€“ The longest, whip-like structure that extends outside the cell.  
2. **Hook** â€“ A short, curved structure that connects the filament to the basal body.  
3. **Basal Body** â€“ Anchors the flagellum to the cell wall and plasma membrane, facilitating rotation.  

### **Pili and Fimbriae**  
- **Pili** are hair-like structures that help in bacterial conjugation (transfer of genetic material).  
- **Fimbriae** are shorter, numerous structures that help bacteria attach to surfaces.  

### **Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria**  
Bacteria are classified based on the Gram staining method:  
- **Gram-Positive Bacteria** â€“ Have a thick peptidoglycan layer and retain the crystal violet stain, appearing purple.  
- **Gram-Negative Bacteria** â€“ Have a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane, appearing pink after staining.  

### **Slime Layer and Capsule**  
- **Slime Layer** â€“ A loosely attached, gelatinous covering that helps in adhesion and protection.  
- **Capsule** â€“ A well-organized, thick layer that protects bacteria from phagocytosis and dehydration.  

### **Mesosome**  
Mesosomes are folded extensions of the plasma membrane that play a role in cellular respiration, DNA replication, and cell division in prokaryotes.
