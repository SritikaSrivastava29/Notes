Okay, here are notes on Respiration, drawing heavily from NCERT concepts and including explanations, reactions, and diagrams where possible.

**I. Introduction**

* **Respiration:**  A catabolic process involving the breakdown of complex organic molecules (like glucose) into simpler substances (like carbon dioxide and water), releasing energy in the process. This energy is stored as ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency.  It's important to distinguish respiration from breathing (or ventilation), which is simply the exchange of gases between an organism and its environment.
* **Cellular Respiration:**  Respiration occurring within the cells of an organism.  This is where the actual energy production takes place.
* **Respiratory Substrates:** The organic molecules that are broken down during respiration.  Glucose is the most common, but other carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and even organic acids can be used.

**II. Do Plants Breathe?**

Yes, plants respire. While they produce oxygen during photosynthesis, they also need to use oxygen for respiration to break down the glucose they create and generate ATP for their own cellular processes.  They have specialized structures for gas exchange (stomata in leaves, lenticels in stems, and root hairs).

**III. Glycolysis**

Glycolysis is the first step in cellular respiration and occurs in the cytoplasm. It's an anaerobic process (doesn't require oxygen) that breaks down glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) into two molecules of pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule).

* **Steps of Glycolysis (Overview with Diagram):**

[Unfortunately, I can't directly *draw* diagrams here. I'll describe the key steps and you can easily find excellent diagrams in your NCERT textbook or online.  The diagram should show the sequential steps and the input/output of molecules.]

1. **Phosphorylation of Glucose:** Glucose is phosphorylated (addition of phosphate) to form Glucose-6-phosphate, using ATP.
2. **Isomerization:** Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to its isomer, Fructose-6-phosphate.
3. **Phosphorylation of Fructose-6-phosphate:** Another ATP is used to phosphorylate Fructose-6-phosphate, forming Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
4. **Cleavage:** Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is split into two 3-carbon molecules: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
5. **Isomerization:** DHAP is converted to G3P. Now, we have two molecules of G3P.
6. **Oxidation and Phosphorylation:** G3P is oxidized and phosphorylated, forming 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate.  This step involves the reduction of NAD+ to NADH.
7. **Substrate-Level Phosphorylation:** 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate transfers a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP and 3-Phosphoglycerate.
8. **Isomerization:** 3-Phosphoglycerate is converted to 2-Phosphoglycerate.
9. **Dehydration:** 2-Phosphoglycerate loses a water molecule, forming Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).
10. **Substrate-Level Phosphorylation:** PEP transfers its phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP and pyruvate.

* **Reactions of Glycolysis (Simplified):**

Glucose + 2 ATP + 2 NAD+ → 2 Pyruvate + 4 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H2O

* **Net Gain from Glycolysis:** 2 ATP (4 produced - 2 consumed) and 2 NADH.

**IV. Fermentation**

Fermentation is an anaerobic process that occurs when oxygen is not available. It's a way to regenerate NAD+ so that glycolysis can continue.  There are two main types:

* **Major Pathways of Anaerobic Respiration (Diagram):**

[Again, I can't draw, but your NCERT textbook has a great diagram showing both pathways.]

1. **Lactic Acid Fermentation:** Pyruvate is reduced by NADH to form lactic acid.  This occurs in muscle cells during intense exercise when oxygen supply is limited.
2. **Alcoholic Fermentation:** Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde, which is then reduced by NADH to ethanol. This occurs in yeast.

* **Simplified Reactions:**

* **Lactic Acid Fermentation:** Pyruvate + NADH → Lactic Acid + NAD+
* **Alcoholic Fermentation:** Pyruvate → Acetaldehyde + CO2; Acetaldehyde + NADH → Ethanol + NAD+

**V. Aerobic Respiration**

Aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen and yields much more ATP than anaerobic respiration. It involves two main stages:

* **Overview with Reactions:**

Pyruvate (from glycolysis) is transported into the mitochondria. Here, it is completely oxidized to CO2 and water. The energy released is used to generate a large amount of ATP. Aerobic respiration includes the Krebs cycle (TCA cycle) and the Electron Transport System (ETS) coupled with oxidative phosphorylation.

* **Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):**

[The Krebs cycle is complex, involving many steps and enzymes.  Refer to your NCERT book for the detailed cycle and the structures of the molecules involved.]

In summary, pyruvate is converted to Acetyl CoA, which enters the cycle.  A series of reactions occur, releasing CO2, NADH, and FADH2.  GTP is also produced.

* **Electron Transport System (ETS) and Oxidative Phosphorylation:**

* **ETS (Diagram):**

[Your NCERT textbook has a good diagram.  It shows the various protein complexes (I-IV) embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.]

NADH and FADH2, produced during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, donate their electrons to the ETS.  The electrons are passed along the chain of carriers, releasing energy at each step. This energy is used to pump protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient.  Oxygen is the final electron acceptor, combining with electrons and protons to form water.

* **Diagrammatic Presentation of ATP Synthesis in Mitochondria:**

The proton gradient created by the ETS drives ATP synthesis.  Protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix through an enzyme called ATP synthase. This flow of protons provides the energy for ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP, forming ATP. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation.

**VI. The Respiratory Balance Sheet**

* **Overview:**

The respiratory balance sheet is an attempt to calculate the net ATP production from cellular respiration. However, it's important to note that it's a theoretical maximum. Actual ATP yield can vary depending on various factors.

* **Calculations:**

* Glycolysis: 2 ATP (net) + 2 NADH (which can yield ~6 ATP in ETS) = ~8 ATP
* Pyruvate Oxidation & Krebs Cycle: 2 GTP + 8 NADH ( ~24 ATP) + 2 FADH2 (~4 ATP) = ~30 ATP
* Total: ~38 ATP (theoretical maximum)

* **Important Considerations:**

* The actual ATP yield can be lower due to factors like leakage of protons across the mitochondrial membrane and the energy used to transport ATP out of the mitochondria.
* The ATP yield from NADH can vary slightly depending on the shuttle system used to transport electrons from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.

This comprehensive breakdown, referencing NCERT concepts, should provide a solid foundation for your understanding of respiration.  Remember to refer to your textbook for the detailed diagrams of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the ETS.  Understanding these visual representations is crucial.
