The **cell cycle** is a process that allows a cell to grow, replicate its DNA, and divide into two daughter cells. It consists of two major phases: **Interphase** and **M Phase** (Mitosis).

### 1. **Interphase**  
This is the longest phase of the cell cycle, where the cell grows and prepares for division. It has three subphases:
- **G1 Phase (Gap 1)**: The cell grows and performs its regular functions. It prepares the necessary proteins and organelles for DNA replication.
- **S Phase (Synthesis)**: DNA replication occurs during this phase, where each chromosome is duplicated to ensure that both daughter cells get an identical set of chromosomes.
- **G2 Phase (Gap 2)**: The cell continues to grow and synthesize proteins that will be needed for cell division. It checks for any DNA damage before mitosis begins.

### 2. **M Phase (Mitosis Phase)**  
This phase is where the cell divides into two daughter cells and consists of two parts: **karyokinesis** (nuclear division) and **cytokinesis** (cytoplasmic division).

#### a. **Karyokinesis** (Nuclear Division)
This involves the division of the cell's nucleus and is divided into four stages:
- **Prophase**: Chromosomes condense and become visible. The nuclear membrane begins to break down, and spindle fibers start to form from the centrosomes.
- **Metaphase**: Chromosomes align along the center (equator) of the cell. Spindle fibers attach to the centromere of each chromosome.
- **Anaphase**: The sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite sides of the cell as the spindle fibers shorten.
- **Telophase**: Chromatids reach the poles of the cell, and new nuclear membranes form around each set of chromosomes, resulting in two distinct nuclei.

#### b. **Cytokinesis** (Cytoplasmic Division)
This is the final step of cell division, where the cytoplasm divides. In animal cells, the membrane pinches in to separate the two daughter cells, while in plant cells, a cell plate forms between the two nuclei, eventually developing into a cell wall.

At the end of the cell cycle, two genetically identical daughter cells are produced, each with a complete set of chromosomes.
